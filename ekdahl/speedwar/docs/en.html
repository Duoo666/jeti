<h1>Speed warnigns lua</h1>
Helps you fly at safe speed, without having a lot of false alarms while on ground or doing repeated takeoff and landings. Warnings with audio and haptic.

<p>

<h2>Supporting the following warnings:</h2>
<ul>
<li>OverSpeed - plays audio file when you fly faster than this speed</li>
<li>MinimumSafeSpeed - plays audio file when you fly slower than minimum safe speed. This alarm is enabled after the first time you hit the safe speed, so it will not sound on the ground.</li>
<li>TakeOffSpeed - plays audio file when takeoff speed is ok and ready to rotate and will not alarm in the air. Will reset if you are under takeoff speed for 10 seconds. Will not play on the ground.</li>
<li>StallSpeed - plays audio file when stall speed limit is reached - This alarm is enabled after the first time you hit the stall speed, so it will not sound on the ground.</li>
</ul>
